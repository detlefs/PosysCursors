To easily install the cursors in Windows 10 and below, do the following:

Agree to these terms: I am not responsible if anything happens to software or hardware.
You can always manually install the cursors, or check the installer yourself by opening it in Notepad.

Drag the folders out of the Zip file.

2.
Open a folder ("Posy's Cursor Black" for example)

3.
Right click the "_Install" file, and choose "install" in the menu. Discard any warning messages if they appear.

4a.
Go to the cursor options.
(In Windows 10, search for "Themes" (in your language) and open themes. Then click the "Mouse Cursor" button.)

In the Mouse options, go to the "Pointers" tab.
