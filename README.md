# Posy's Cursors

These are the original improved cursors created by Michiel de Boer in 2018.

Details can be found on his [website](http://www.michieldb.nl/other/cursors/) and on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YThelfB2fvg)

As Michiel doesn't include a license to the cursors, I assume they are free to use, and it should be no problem to host them here on GitHub as long as there is a reference to the original creator included..

I added the package to GitHub only as a personal backup and a way to easily deploy them to multiple computers.

## Installation

Each cursor package contains a `_install Posy*.inf` file that can be used to install the fonts.
In the context-menu for the `.inf` file, simply click on **Install** to have them installed.

**Note:** in Windows 11 the option is hidden behind the **Show more options** entry of the context menu

## Enabling the cursor set

Open the classic Control Panel, search/click **Mouse**, click **Pointers** and then select the **Posy's Cursor \*** scheme from the drop-down.
